abstract: 'The number of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users has been increasing rapidly in recent years, especially
among youth and young adults. More e-cigarette products have become available, including e-liquids with various brands and
flavors. Various e-liquid flavors have been frequently discussed by e-cigarette users on social media. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal prevalence of mentions of electronic cigarette liquid (e-liquid) flavors
and user perceptions on social media. We applied a data-driven approach to analyze the trends and macro-level user sentiments of different e-cigarette
flavors on social media. With data collected from web-based stores, e-liquid flavors were classified into categories in a flavor
hierarchy based on their ingredients. The e-cigarette–related posts were collected from social media platforms, including Reddit
and Twitter, using e-cigarette–related keywords. The temporal trend of mentions of e-liquid flavor categories was compiled using
Reddit data from January 2013 to April 2019. Twitter data were analyzed using a sentiment analysis from May to August 2019
to explore the opinions of e-cigarette users toward each flavor category. More than 1000 e-liquid flavors were classified into 7 major flavor categories. The fruit and sweets categories were
the 2 most frequently discussed e-liquid flavors on Reddit, contributing to approximately 58% and 15%, respectively, of all
flavor-related posts. We showed that mentions of the fruit flavor category had a steady overall upward trend compared with other
flavor categories that did not show much change over time. Results from the sentiment analysis demonstrated that most e-liquid
flavor categories had significant positive sentiments, except for the beverage and tobacco categories. The most updated information about the popular e-liquid flavors mentioned on social media was investigated,
which showed that the prevalence of mentions of e-liquid flavors and user perceptions on social media were different. Fruit was
the most frequently discussed flavor category on social media. Our study provides valuable information for future regulation of
flavored e-cigarettes.'
